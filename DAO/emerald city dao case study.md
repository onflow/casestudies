## :dizzy: What is Emerald City DAO?
Emerald City is the first DAO on Flow, founded in early November of 2021. We have formed 3 Guilds to accomplish our goals:
1. Education Guild - Educating the Flow ecosystem on Flow & Cadence development
2. Building Guild - Developing tooling & products for DAOs/projects on Flow
3. Governance Guild - Architecting and building crucial (fair and inclusive) governance strategies for DAOs on Flow.

## :pencil2: What makes Emerald City DAO unique?
**1. Educate the Flow ecosystem** 

This is unique simply because education on Flow is so rare, in fact mostly non-existant. Outside of my (Jacob's) YouTube channel, there are no Cadence educational resources to get people interested in the language. Thus, one of our goals at Emerald City is to educate developers and onboard people into the Flow ecosystem. We are doing that with our "Emerald Academy", [which you can find here](https://academy.ecdao.org). We host bootcamps nearly every month to engage the Flow ecosystem and help teach everyone about the wonders of Flow and Cadence. In addition, all of our graduates have first-class access to open developer positions and work opportunities in the space.

**2. Build necessary tooling for DAOs/projects on Flow** 

We noticed that it is sometimes hard for project leads to run their communities optimally because the necessary tooling doesn't exist. For example, gating access to Discord channels based on on-chain assets. Thus our second goal is to build the tooling needed for these projects. 

In addition, because we are constantly building tooling, we have so many opportunities within the DAO to take our learners and bring them real-world Flow projects almost immediately. We already know their experience levels and interest levels, so it's really easy for us to get people developing on projects they love, which benefits everybody.

**3. Paving the way for DAOs on Flow**

DAOs do not exist on Flow, at least to a large extent. Thus we have taken on the responsibility of redesigning common DAO practices we have seen on other Blockchains (like Ethereum) to bring the most fair, balanced, and community-centric approach to Flow. Our goal is not only to architect DAO best-practices, but to recognize and prohibit bad practices that we have seen spread across the Blockchain industry.

## :ocean: Why did you Build on Flow?
I started learning about Blockchain in my university's club. In that club we learned a little about Solidity, and it was pretty cool. To be fully honest, I wasn't 100% invested in it, and mostly forgot about it until the Summer of 2020 when I received an email from my club to participate in Flow's Open World Builders 2020 bootcamp. 

Knowing nearly nothing about Blockchain, I completed the Open World Builders bootcamp and absolutely loved Flow. What I loved most about it was that coding in Cadence felt like a video game. It was fun to do, I was early so I felt special, and the Flow team was incredibly kind and helpful the entire way. My most memorable experiences were with Max Starka, a member of the Flow team who constantly encouraged me to continue learning Cadence and never failed to make the process welcoming. I would honestly say I stuck around because of him and how fun Cadence is.

I stayed long term because of the community and of all the projects I have worked on. I love all the people here and have built some amazing products and platforms, so I am in this for the long run.

## :wrench: What was your experience building with Cadence?
I started learning Cadence during the Summer of 2020 during the Open World Builders bootcamp. Back in those days, Cadence was still pretty new, so a lot of the features today weren't existant yet. I immediately fell in love with it because it was pretty easy to learn and helped me learn so much about Blockchain as a whole. Cadence separates transactions & scripts from the contract layer, so it's a very intuitive approach to smart contract development.

Since then I have written the smart contracts for MotoGP, advised tens of projects, written most of the smart contracts for Emerald City, and more. One of Cadence's top selling points is how easy it is to read and understand. In Solidity, I find myself constantly questioning what on earth a contract is doing because of its inheritence structure and lack of separation between contracts and transactions. And this is coming from someone who has developed on Solidity for almost 2 years now. 

Cadence is also very secure, and makes it very very hard for the developer to mess up. There's a reason you hear so many hacks on Ethereum but not on Flow. It's because Cadence's strict typing mechanisms and resource-oriented programming makes developing easy and messing up hard.

I also believe Cadence serves as a fantastic entry point to learning Blockchain development. [I would definitely check out my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6DzMRwj7SJ3nPrZqd5hHw) to learn more about it.

## :globe_with_meridians: How does your Web3 investment tie into your broad business strategy?
Our primary goals are to build up the Flow community and provide projects with the tools necessary to building their products and communities, and moreso to just open the doors for more projects to get started on Flow. So, our "business strategy" is entrenched within Web3 already.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Key Metrics
The key metrics we are focused on are the following:
* 5,500 community members in our Discord
* Nearly every single project and DAO on Flow are using our [Emerald bot](https://emeralddao.notion.site/emeralddao/Emerald-bot-962a1d4c22a5417baad56ba5c79fdfcd)
* 20% of developers have landed full-time positions after graduating from our [Academy](https://academy.ecdao.org)
* 70,000 [FLOATs](https://floats.city) claimed and 500 events created

## :handshake: Core Collaborators in the Web3 Space
We collaborate with pretty much every single project and DAO on Flow at the moment. We do so to really get close to the community and ask folks what kinds of things they'd like to see built, and we get it done.


## :money_with_wings: Investors
No, we do not have any investors. In fact we aren't earning anything at the moment.

## :thought_balloon: Advice
Although simple, my advice is: just do it. 

When I started on Flow, I knew nothing about Blockchain development. Within 3 months I was writing the contracts for MotoGP, one of the highest-earning NFT drops in Flow history. When I founded Emerald City DAO, I had never even joined or read about DAOs in my life. 5 months later we are the first ever DAO on Flow and arguably the most active developer/educational community. 

All of this is just to say: go for it! It doesn't matter if you haven't mastered something. The truth is, everyone is just doing their best and stumbling their way to success. Oh, but also join Emerald City. We may have some opportunities for you ;)

## :busts_in_silhouette: The Team
There are 5.5k other members in our Discord, and ~50 active developers at all times who are interested in working on various projects across the DAO. In addition, I would say there are a few hundred actively learning Flow and Cadence development through our materials. 

**Jacob Tucker**:
*Founder*

I got started in the Flow ecosystem in the Summer of 2020 during the Open World Builder bootcamp. I've been developing on Flow ever since then, and naturally rose to one of the community leads in the space (because of my unbeatable skills and natural born charisma). I founded Emerald City DAO and take the lead on most projects within to help develop and guide contributors to where they need to be. [I also run this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6DzMRwj7SJ3nPrZqd5hHw) which I believe is the only up-to-date educational resource for Flow/Cadence developers.

**Bam**:
*Early Founder/Guild Leader*

One of the first members of the DAO, Bam has been a member of Emerald City since its creation. At the beginning, Bam did not know much about Cadence development, but is now working on the .find team to develop smart contracts. Bam has been an absolutely crucial part of encouraging and educating community. He plays a large part of our Education Guild.

**Kelcoin**:
*Early Founder/Guild Leader*

One of the first members of the DAO along with Bam, Kelcoin has been an integral part of our community building. He is always there to answer questions about where to go inside Emerald City, what to expect, how to contribute, etc. Kelcoin is a big part of our Governance Guild, as he constantly educates our community about DAO best practices.

**Andrea Muttoni**:
*Guild Leader*

Andrea is a member of the Flow team and a Guild Leader at Emerald City. He got started with Emerald City DAO about a month or so in and has been extremely beneficial to us not only on the development side but also onboarding and encouraging tons of developers to be interested in Emerald City, and more broadly, Flow. Andrea co-developed [FLOAT](https://floats.city) with Jacob, and helped to provide tons of support for [Emerald Academy](https://academy.ecdao.org) as well. Andrea plays a most active role in our Education and Building guilds.

**Bjartek**:
*Guild Leader*

Bjartek began his Flow journey with Jacob during the Summer of 2020. He developed [Versus](https://www.versus.auction/) and founded the [.find](https://find.xyz) project, and is a Guild Leader at Emerald City. Bjartek has been helping most in our Education Guild to teach new developers the Cadence ropes.

**Dene**
*Guild Leader*

Dene is the founder of [GENIACE](https://www.geniace.com/) and a Guild Leader at Emerald City. Dene has provided incredible support in our Building Guild. The GENIACE team developed our [main website](https://ecdao.org) and designed all of our logos.

**Support Monkey**
*Guild Leader*

Support Monkey is the founder of [Atlas 3DSS](https://atlas3dss.com/) and a Guild Leader at Emerald City. Support Monkey has played a crucial role inside our Governance Guild as he constantly provides us with DAO best practices and educates us on the "do"s and "don't"s in the Blockchain world.
